Welcome to the Princeton Energy Repository

## Goals
Using data from PSEG, EIA, EPA, NJ Clean Energy Program and other agencies, develop technology and visualizations that will analyze and display Princeton’s greenhouse gas emissions over time. Create simple quantitative comparisons that will help residents, businesses and other community members understand the impact their efforts to reduce energy consumption can have on Princeton’s greenhouse gas emissions as a whole.

Resources
- PSEG electric and gas usage for Princeton commercial and residential properties 2009 to current 
- EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration) state energy consumption data
- EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator

## Dataset Information
Data from 2009 for Gas and Electric usage in Princeton Township and Boro, categorized by Industrial, Commercial, and Residential.

- Industrial category is not "true" industrial and can be considered Commercial 
- Classification of Industrial is based on SIC code 
- Includes Princeton University property in the Commercial category
- kWh & Therms are billing information and not actual usage -  In the vast majority of cases they are one and the same but they will be instances either because of an estimated bill or a corrected bill where they can be different. This explains negative values in kWh & Therms.
- PSEG can provide data in excel on a Quarterly basis 
- No limitations on use of data as it is in aggregate 
- Meter to resident or commercial is roughly 1:1
- Data needs to be weather normalized using heating and cooling degree data for the area
